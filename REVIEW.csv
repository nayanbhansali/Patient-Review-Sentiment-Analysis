Hospital,Patient's Review,Class
Well Key Health,Took my 8-year-old daughter for a UTI. The staff was phenomenal and better with kids than most places just for kids. Wish I got their names but the lady at check-in and the nurse or MA who took her vitals you ladies deserve a raise and recognition for your excellent attitudes and service. Much obliged.,1
Well Key Health,"My 7 year old son just went for his 2nd visit to Well-Key. Both visits were on a Sunday evening. We were in and out in under an hour both times, with hardly any wait time. Even for a weekend night, the staff was super friendly and kind, from check-in to check out. Everyone made sure he got a Popsicle and stickers and said they hoped he felt better. A note for school was ready at check out. The prescription was ready as soon as we got to the pharmacy. I cannot say enough good things. Iâ€™ve told everyone I know what a great place this is! Thanks so much Well-Key!",1
Well Key Health,I appreciate the cleanliness of the office! Such a great benefit that the office was open on Easter evening. The front desk attendant was so nice and helpful. It was the best walk in clinic experience.,1
Well Key Health,I was treated with respect and the staff had a professional attitude. I would recommend Well-Key to anyone who is looking for an Urgent Care and already have. Everyone was great!,1
Well Key Health,"The nurse was amazing. She was very caring and sweet. She knew what she was doing and was so helpful. If I am ever in need while I am visiting, I would come here again.",1
Well Key Health,All the employees were professional and so very kind. I like that they listen to me and seem genuinely caring about my problems. Thank you.,1
Well Key Health,I only had to wait less than 5 minutes. The nurses worked quickly and were polite. Dr. Huskey ran the necessary tests and the examination revealed both a sinus and an ear infection. She explained my illness and the course of action. I was extremely pleased with my visit to the Sevierville Well-Key Urgent Care.,1
Well Key Health,My regular doctor had no open appointments so I went to Well-Key. They were very professional and very helpful. This was my first visit to a walk-in clinic and needless to sayâ€¦I picked a great one!,1
Well Key Health,"I appreciate the friendly, non-threatening atmosphere and the prompt attention I received. I have already recommended Well-Key to many friends and would not hesitate to return if necessary. Thank you!",1
Well Key Health,"The care was outstanding all the way from start to finish. The Doctor put forth a high level of effort to deliver results. The support staff was very professional and pleasant. The facility was well equipped and designed for patient privacy, service and efficiency. The electronic prescription process worked great. The insurance was handled equally as well. Recognizing it may be difficult â€¦.. an opportunity for enhancement would be partial merging of the patient data forms. We will highly recommend â€œWell-keyâ€ at every opportunity. Great JOB !!!",1
Well Key Health,Absolutely IMPRESSED! The staff was fantastic and the best partâ€¦the doctor (Michael Rothwell)â€¦OUTSTANDING! Very compassionate and patient. Great experience and wonâ€™t go to any other walk-in but Well-Key!,1
Well Key Health,"I have an old wrist injury that flared up suddenly 2 days before I needed to be on a plane for a business trip, (of course, itâ€™s in my writing hand). It was easy to check in and I was seen very quickly. I explained my problem and received a great short-term solution and felt better within hours. I was given prescriptions to take with me on the trip in case there was any further issues. Nice people, fast service, great results. THANK YOU ALL!",1
Well Key Health,"The fast courteous response of the staff at check in, to the timeliness with the practitioner and the doctor was an overall pleasant experience. I was well cared for and felt the warmth from all parties involved in my visit!",1
Well Key Health,The wait time in the waiting room as well as in the examining room was not long at all. Pleasant staff and they took the time to listen and didnâ€™t rush through things. Overall great experience! Thank you!,1
Well Key Health,"My ear infection was taken care of without any fuss. The doctor was knowledgeable and confident. If I ever get ill outside of my doctorâ€™s hours, I will not hesitate to go back!",1
Well Key Health,"We were in Pigeon Forge this weekend at our cabin and I noticed I was getting pink eye Saturday afternoon. After having a miserable night Saturday night I decided to go to an after hour medical clinic on Sunday morning, and my husband remembered seeing your clinic. Being from out of town I was unsure how to get an appointment and how my insurance would work, but the professional staff at Well-Key made it easy to see the Doctor and get medicine to feel better. Thanks for taking care of me and being so kind and helpful!",1
Well Key Health,"I came in with a sinus infection at 8:00 am. was seen within 10 minutes and got checked, obtained a prescription and away I went within 30 minutes. Outstanding service by the front desk and the intake lady and the P.A. Couldnâ€™t have been treated any better.",1
Well Key Health,Was in for a sinus infection. Very short wait which Iâ€™m sure is unusual for such a busy place. The people I saw were very professional and knowledgeable. Thanks!,1
Well Key Health,"Very professional, yet friendly Doctor and staff. In and out quick.",1
Well Key Health,I was able to download patient forms online and walked in with the forms completed. You are welcomed by smiling faces and my wait time was less than 6 minutes. The nurse was exceptional and very knowledgable. The doctor showed concern and treated me like a patient (not a number/quota). I was in/out in under 30 minutes. I will definitely visit Well-Key again!!! Great customer service!,1
Well Key Health,"The office was very clean and well kept. The staff was great! Very nice, clean and professional appearance. The wait time was very minimum.",1
Well Key Health,Staff was very helpful and friendly. I was also very impressed with the doctor. I would not hesitate to return if needed and would not hesitate to recommend the clinic.l!,1
Well Key Health,"I was seen promptly, diagnosed quickly! Very professional staff, very friendly. The place was immaculate. I was very impressed! It was Sunday morning so I was hoping I wouldnâ€™t have to wait a long time. I was seen almost before i got my paperwork filled out!",1
Well Key Health,My Mother had been up sick all night. She was dehydrated and could hardly function. Each care provider we encountered from the front desk to the Doctor was caring and friendly. They continued to check on her as tests were running and even brought her a blanket. I never doubted their competency. By the time we left there her color had returned and she was laughing and wanting to fix her hair! I am so grateful.,1
Well Key Health,"Excellent care from the minute I checked in with the office staff, the nurse screening and procedures, and the doctorâ€™s knowledge and diagnosis of my problem.",1
Well Key Health,"From registration to medical assistant to physician, everyone was kind and helpful and everything went smoothly and quickly. So appreciate having Well-Key close by for times when needed. Will not hesitate to visit again if need be.",1
Well Key Health,Dr. spent time explaining his diagnosis. Other caretakers were courteous and expedient. Wait time was minimal. Very clean. I would highly recommend Well-Key. Thanks for what you do.,1
Well Key Health,"The receptionist greeted me immediately. Doctor took a good bit of time with me and asked if I had any questions. Wait time was very reasonable. If my family needs an urgent care again, we will return to this facility.",1
Well Key Health,"You did a great job, I was well pleased. The wait was short & the staff was very prompt.I would highly recommend you. Thank you, Thank you!!",1
Well Key Health,"I came in with what I thought was a bad cut. Turned out to be a somewhat minor, but long cut. I believe the whole experience took less than 1 hour, which I was surprised. Iâ€™ve had great care when it was Smoky Mountain Urgent Care, and Iâ€™m glad to see it continues under Well-Key.",1
Well Key Health,Always an enjoyable experience. Even when you are sick and feel awful. Very efficient. We were in and out in about 30 minutes.,1
Well Key Health,"Obviously I was not feeling well when I stopped at this facility for care. And great care is what I received! From the receptionist to the nurse to the doctor. The office is exceptionally clean and I was in and out in less than an hour. Everyone that I came in contact with made me feel cared for, and my nurse even made me laugh. Hoping to feel better soon with medication that was called in!",1
Well Key Health,"Iâ€™ve never had to wait an extreme amount of time, your hours are great and your staff and doctors are top notch. Always friendly and caring and i have never felt like just a number to be dealt with. Thank you so much.",1
Well Key Health,"Excellent, no wait, saw the md, took care of the problem, there was no wasted time and I felt like all my concerns were addressed.",1
Well Key Health,"Wait time wasnâ€™t bad considering the amount of patients to be seen. I was there just over an hour start to finish. I was also very pleased with the doctor that I saw, he was very informative and professional. I also liked his â€œbed sideâ€ manner, he was very friendly.",1
Well Key Health,Was very happy with the attention from the doctor and nurse regarding my illness. In and out in a timely manner.,1
Well Key Health,"More thorough than my regular provider would have been. Very professional, compassionate staff. Will definitely use this facility again.!",1
Well Key Health,Very efficient and was out of there in an hour. I will refer Well-Key to anyone needing emergent care or after hours care.,1
Well Key Health,They took the time to talk and explain everything. Didnâ€™t try to push me in and out for a quick turn-around like most other places I have been. I would definitely recommend.,1
Well Key Health,"I was greeted warmly and seen quickly. And though I could not be fully helped at the facility, I was given a quick referral that got me to the right place immediately.",1
Well Key Health,I have never been to a place that has been as kind and friendly as you all. You all gave me the best care ever and that means a lot. The Doctor was real great and cared a lot to make sure I got well and better. I will be recommending you all to everyone.,1
Well Key Health,"I waited a few minutes, but not too long. It was a pleasant experience, and I received the medical care and â€œbootâ€ I needed. I rushed to get there because I had a meeting to get to and I was only a few minutes late. I would likely still be waiting at the emergency room if I went there instead.",1
Well Key Health,"Everyone there was very polite and treated as youâ€™ve been coming there forever. We brought our boys there to be checked out for upper respiratory problems. They are 11 and 5. My oldest son has autism, and the doctor, she was amazing with him. She was wonderfuly patient with both boys, but very special with my oldest.",1
Well Key Health,I walked in for a DOT physical without an appointment and the whole staff was very gracious and managed to fit me in right away! Very impressive. The entire staff was great and I recommend the facility to all.,1
Well Key Health,"The doctor was wonderful and thorough. I had a different doctor last week ( another child sick), she was also AMAZING. She had blonde hair and was a Medical Director. Loved her.",1
Well Key Health,The medical staff at Well-Key was exceptional and I would highly recommend them to anyone. I was taken in quickly and my physician was very thorough with excellent care in a very timely manner.,1
Well Key Health,"I came to your office due to an eye problem. I was greeted very nicely and after completing paperwork was taken back almost immediately. The doctor assistant took all the necessary info and the nurse practitioner came in to see me. That to me is almost unheard ofâ€¦ You normally wait and wait. She assessed the problem, made a decision for medication and I was on the way. Everyone was very caring and efficient. Sure wish we could come here for our regular medical needs.",1
Well Key Health,"I was very pleased with the manner in which both the nurse and the doctor handled my son. It was his first time getting staples and he was very nervous, but the doctor and the nurse kept him calm. We will recommend Well-Key to our friends.",1
Well Key Health,"Courteous, prompt, and knowledgeable service from front desk staff, clinical staff, and physician! I would have had to wait another 3 weeks to see my â€œregularâ€ doctor. Instead, I received initial treatment from Well-Key and will follow-up with my â€œregularâ€ doctor.",1
Well Key Health,"Myself, my husband an my daughter have all been seen here in the past two weeks. I have never been more impressed with a clinic and all the staff. The doctors were all amazing and for my daughter the Doctor was so kind and good to her. I wish I could use your clinic as a primary care place because you have the best doctors!!",1
Well Key Health,"While on vacation from Alabama, our 3 year old son became sick. The nurse practitioner was so kind and gentle with my son and everyone I dealt with was very professional and kind. We were in and out in about an hour. Thanks again for taking care of my baby while we were away from home!",1
Well Key Health,All of the staff were amazing! I was in and out in just under 25 minutes! Will come again!,1
Well Key Health,I really liked the Doctor. They took their time with you efficiently and professionally. The nurse that gave me a steroid shot didnâ€™t hurt me at allâ€¦till about 10 minutes after he gave it! Lol. Thank you for providing medical care outside of going to an ER!,1
Well Key Health,"There wasnâ€™t too much paperwork, my wait was short, and the technologist and doctor were quick, informative, and friendly. They recognized that I have a certain amount of knowledge about healthcare, and interacted with me appropriately.",1
Well Key Health,"I walked in 5 mins before closing time, I thought I would get a staff ready to go home and not happy to see me so close to closing time but thatâ€™s not at all what I received! Such a happy, helpful, and professional staff from the lady at the front deak to the assistant who gave me my shot and the doctor all class acts! I will definitely be backâ€¦ Well I hope I stay healthy and donâ€™t have to, but if I do get sick again, I will be back at Well-Key!!",1
Well Key Health,I was extremely pleased to visit a doctor who showed genuine concern and took time to talk to me. Most physicians make you feel uncomfortable and as if your thoughts and ideas are unimportant. The entire staff was so helpful and considerate.,1
Well Key Health,I had sick twin boys. The staff was able to process us quickly and get us in a room. They saw both boys at the same time which was nice. And the nurses and the doctor were knowledgeable and very nice and caring. The boys even got a popsicle to finish out their visit.,1
Well Key Health,Was so sick and so happy you were open at 6:00 pm on Saturday evening. Feeling better just a few hours later due to aggressive treatment â€“ shots!! I will definitely recommend this clinic to friends and family.,1
